## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.9.8



```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

*Note: In rare case such a requirements file created with `pip freeze` might not ensure that another (especially M1 chip) user can install and execute it properly. This can happen if libraries need to be compiled (e.g. SciPy). Then it also depends on environment variables and the actual system libraries.*

### Unit testing (Optional)

 In order to run the tests execute in terminal:

```bash
pytest
```
